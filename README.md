# DevClassCsharp2022
Code Louisville's C Sharp class 2022
Wahooo, time to start a new class in C#, wish me luck!
We will be doing a project to put in the portfolio, attend classes, interact with 1 tech event, complete Plural Sight courses for C#, interview someone in the tech field, and attend a job-readiness workshop.
